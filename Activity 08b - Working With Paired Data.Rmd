# Darwin example

Today's activity will be about how to analyze and interpret data that is collected in pairs. 

The example we'll look at is one from an experiment conducted by Charles Darwin. He wanted to look at the heights of cross-fertilized versus self-fertilized plants. To do this, he took 15 pots and potted one plant of each type in each pot. The plants were then measured after a certain period of time, and their heights were recorded. Below is code to read the data into R.

```{r}
darwin <- data.frame(pot = factor(1:15),
                     cross = c(23.500, 12.000, 21.000, 22.000, 19.125,
                               21.500, 22.125, 20.375, 18.250, 21.625,
                               23.250, 21.000, 22.125, 23.000, 12.000),
                     self = c(17.375, 20.375, 20.000, 20.000, 18.375,
                              18.625, 18.625, 15.250, 16.500, 18.000,
                              16.250, 18.000, 12.750, 15.500, 18.000))

```

1. What kinds of numerical and/or graphical summaries might we be interested in for this data? Write code to do these summaries and write a couple of sentences about what you see.

```{r}

```

2. Did you make use of the `pot` variable at all? Why do you think Darwin put one plant of each type in each pot?

# Analyzing Paired Data

It might be tempting to see the two separate groups (cross-fertilized plants and self-fertilized plants) and to analyze this like other problems with two groups. However, these groups aren't *independent*. What that means is each pot may be a bit different (e.g different soil moisture, acidity, etc.). Since pairs of plants shared a pot, we should make use of this information in our analysis.

3. For problems with paired data, we will calculate the **difference** between our two groups for every single pot. Let's add a variable to our dataset called `diff` that contains the difference (`cross - self`) in heights for the plants in each pot.

```{r}

```

<br>


4. What we're really interested in is how much taller (or shorter) cross-fertilized plants will grow on average than self-fertilized plants. When we look at the differences, we're able to see what happened when both plants were subjected to the same conditions. Our parameter can be written as $\mu_d$ (the population mean of the differences). What will our estimate of this value be?

5. Let's generate a bootstrap distribution of sample mean *differences* and create a histogram of those differences. Since `diff` is just a single variable, we will do our analysis just as if we were analyzing a problem where we wanted to estimate a *single* population mean. The only difference is that these values were obtained by calculating a difference in plant heights. (Note: Remember to choose a new seed value.)

```{r}
set.seed(92820)

```

<br>


6. Once we have our bootstrap distribution, we could calculate a 90% confidence interval using any of the methods we've learned so far. Calculate a confidence interval, and write it out below.

```{r}

```

**My CI is: ____**

# Interpreting CIs from Paired Data

7. What does it mean if we get all positive values in this confidence interval? What about if we get all negative values?

**<  Answer here >**

<br>


8. Once we've calculated our interval (doing an analysis like we were estimating a single mean), we will interpret the interval like we interpret intervals *comparing two means*! Write an interpretation for the Darwin interval below.

# Want more practice? 

There is a dataset on Moodle called **twins.csv**. The data is from a 1990 study where researchers compared left hippocampus volumes (in $cm^3$) for twins where one twin had schizophrenia (column `affected`) and the other twin did not (column `unaffected`). (Note: This data is also in an R package called `Sleuth3`. You can load `case0202` from this package to access the data and/or read more about it.)

Use the data to investigate whether or not there seems to be a difference in population mean left hippocampus volume for people with/without schizophrenia. 

Create and interpret a 95% confidence interval. Then consider whether there might be limitations or further considerations one should make when trying to generalize these conclusions.
