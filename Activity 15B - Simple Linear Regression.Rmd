We will use the following R packages during today's activity.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(Lock5Data)
```

---

For this activity, we'll use a dataset called `RestaurantTips` from the `Lock5Data` R package. The data was collected by the owner of a bistro in New York and contains 157 bills at the restaurant over a two week period. Let's explore the relationship between the size of the bill, called `Bill`, and the size of the tip, called `Tip`. Both variables are measured in dollars.

I'm going to read the data into R and call it `tips` to shorten the name a bit.

```{r}
tips <- RestaurantTips
```


1. Suppose we want to create a scatterplot comparing the size of the bill and the tip size. Which variable should be the explanatory variable and which should be the response variable? Why?

**ANSWER**


<br>

2. Make a scatterplot comparing the bill size and the tip size.

```{r}

```


<br>

3. Describe the form, direction, and strength of the scatterplot.

   - **Form** -
   - **Direction** - 
   - **Strength** -


<br>

4. Let's use R to calculate a simple linear regression line for this data. Write the formula for the line after you run your R code.

```{r}

```

**Formula:**

<br>

5. Suppose you're a server at the restaurant and someone has just spent \$23.70 on a meal. How much would you predict their tip would be?

**Prediction =**

<br>

6. There was one person in the dataset who actually did have a bill of \$23.70. They left a \$10 tip. What would be the residual for that observation?

**Residual =**


<br>

7. Would it be a good idea to use this data to predict the tip size for a \$200 bill at this restaurant? Why or why not?

**ANSWER**


<br>

8. Would it be a good idea to use this data to predict the tip size for a \$20 bill at The Root here in Elon? Why or why not?

**ANSWER**


<br>

9. You can actually add a simple linear regression line to your scatterplot by adding `geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)` as another layer to your ggplot object. Try this out below. Can you find the observation whose residual we just calculated on the graph? (Note: You will need to respecify your x and y aesthetics in `geom_smooth()` or move them to the `ggplot()` function instead.)

```{r}

```



<br>

10. Interpret the estimated y-intercept in context of this problem. Is this an extrapolation or an interpolation?

**Interpretation of y-intercept:**

<br>

11. Interpret the estimated slope in context of this problem.

**Interpretation of slope:**


<br>

12. Does your estimated slope make sense based on what you know about tipping?

**ANSWER**


<br>

13. The Washington Post article we read for our last activity talked about something called the "R squared" value for a simple linear regression. This value tells us the proportion of the variability in our response variable that can be explained by our explanatory variable in our data set. Use the `summary()` function on the object created by the `lm()` function. Find the R-squared value in the output and write a sentence interpreting it.

**R-squared =**

**Interpretation:**

Bonus: Investigate how well the size of the bill can help predict the tip percentage (`PctTip`).

* Make a scatterplot. What is the relationship between the two variables? How does it compare to what we saw when we compared bill size to tip size (both in terms of dollars).


* Calculate a simple linear regression line and interpret the estimated intercept and estimated slope.
